# ISS-Tracking
"This Python program leverages the Open Notify API to track the real-time position of the International Space Station (ISS). It calculates when the ISS will be passing close to your current location based on your geographic coordinates. When the ISS is near, the program automatically sends a personalized email notification to your specified email address, alerting you to look up and spot the station as it orbits overhead.
